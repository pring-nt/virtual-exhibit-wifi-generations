## Incremental Development Log

### What Was Built

The core deliverable for this increment is a fully functional **Wi-Fi Signal Heatmap Explorer** embedded in the exhibit page. The component is self-contained and covers the full feature loop: floor plan editing, router placement, and per-generation signal heatmap visualization.

### Aha Moments

**shadcn/ui on Tailwind v4 needs explicit path aliases at two levels.**
`tsconfig.json` paths (`"@/*": ["./src/*"]`) handle editor tooling and type resolution, but Vite doesn't read `tsconfig.json` at bundle time. The `resolve.alias` entry in `astro.config.mjs` is what actually makes `@/components/ui/button` resolve at runtime. Both are required.

**CSS variable namespace collision.**
shadcn's generated `tailwind.css` defines variables like `--background`, `--muted`, `--border`, and `--ring` under `:root` globally. The existing `global.css` (which we cannot modify) uses some of the same variable names for the exhibit's link and text colors. shadcn's values were silently overwriting them, causing hyperlinks and text to go near-invisible across the whole site. The fix was scoping shadcn's `:root` block to `.wifi-explorer` instead — the component's root class — so the variables are only defined within the component's subtree and never reach the rest of the page.

**`client:only="react"` vs `client:load`.**
The canvas-based component uses `window` and `document` directly. Astro's default behavior tries to server-render React components before hydrating them on the client, which throws `window is not defined` during the SSR pass. `client:only="react"` skips SSR entirely for the component, which is the correct directive for anything that depends on browser APIs.

---

### Challenges

**Setup complexity for Tailwind v4 + shadcn.**
The combination of using Tailwind v4, an Astro project, a forked repo with locked files, and shadcn's own init process created a longer-than-expected setup chain. Each tool had its own requirements that weren't always compatible out of the box: Tailwind v4 needs the Vite plugin, shadcn needs the CSS entry point pointed at the right file, the path alias needs to exist in both tsconfig and Vite config, and the shadcn CSS variables need to be scoped to avoid colliding with the exhibit's existing styles.

**Working within the locked file constraints.**
`global.css`, both layout files, and the existing components were off-limits. This ruled out the most obvious solutions (import Tailwind in the layout, scope CSS in the layout) and required alternative approaches: importing `tailwind.css` from the MDX page instead, and scoping CSS variables to the component's root class rather than `:root`.

---

### Creative Development

**Dijkstra-based signal propagation instead of a radial gradient.**
The original proposal described the heatmap as "radial gradient painting that propagates outward from the router tile." The actual implementation uses a max-heap Dijkstra algorithm (`Propagation.js`) where signal strength at each cell equals the starting power minus distance falloff minus the sum of wall attenuation penalties along the best-available path. This means the signal automatically routes around walls when doing so preserves more signal than passing through them — which is physically accurate and produces a much more interesting and educational heatmap than a simple radial falloff would.

**Diffusion passes for realistic corner leakage.**
After the main Dijkstra pass, two diffusion rounds propagate a fraction of each cell's signal to orthogonal neighbors. Passes alternate scan direction (forward then backward) to prevent the directional bias that arises when all passes scan in the same order. This keeps corner leakage symmetric without being computationally expensive.

**Heatmap recomputed on edit, not on mode switch.**
The floor plan editor and heatmap view were later merged into a single live canvas instead of two separate modes. Heatmaps are cached per generation index: switching to a generation that's already cached is an instant lookup, switching to one that isn't triggers a single fresh computation. A paint stroke or router drag only recomputes once — on release — since recomputing on every intermediate cell during the drag itself would be far too slow. Any edit invalidates the whole cache, since none of it applies to the new layout anymore.

## Background Overview

The history of Wi-Fi technology is long and varied, depending on who you ask.

Dating back to 1980 in IBM's Rueschlikon Laboratory, Zurich, Switzerland, research on the early conceptions of the wireless local area network (WLAN) using IR technology for manufacturing floors was conducted in order to beat the then-popular wired local area networks (LAN). By 1985, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) opened ISM frequency bands for unlicensed industrial usage with restrictions on having to use spread spectrums, laying the groundwork for the wireless communications we've come to know. In 1997, the IEEE released its first legacy 802.11 standard, and by 1999, the Wi-Fi Alliance was established, and IEEE 802.11b was released, with a 2.4 GHz band, being the first version released worldwide for commercial use. From there, each new generation of the standard brought better reliability, speeds, and range — from 11 Mbps of the 802.11b to the multi-gigabit capabilities of Wi-Fi 7 today.

Regardless of its origins, it may not be hyperbolic to say that Wi-Fi and the advent of wireless technology have helped shape our world into a more interconnected and communicative one.

## Theme Overview

The exhibit covers the evolution of Wi-Fi standards over the decades, from the original 802.11b in 1999 to the latest Wi-Fi 7. The exhibit aims to highlight how each generation of technology gradually improved its speed, range, and reliability in everyday environments.

### Wi-Fi Generations

| Standard | Year | Also Known As | Key Highlights |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 802.11b | 1999 | Wi-Fi 1 | **2.4 GHz**, **11 Mbps** max, CCK modulation |
| 802.11a | 1999 | Wi-Fi 2 | **5 GHz**, **54 Mbps**, OFDM |
| 802.11g | 2003 | Wi-Fi 3 | **2.4 GHz**, **54 Mbps**, OFDM, backward compatible with 802.11b |
| 802.11n | 2009 | Wi-Fi 4 | Dual-band (**2.4 + 5 GHz**), **600 Mbps**, MIMO introduced |
| 802.11ac | 2013 | Wi-Fi 5 | **5 GHz**, **3.5 Gbps** max, MU-MIMO |
| 802.11ax | 2019 | Wi-Fi 6 | Dual-band (**2.4 + 5 GHz**), **9.6 Gbps** max, OFDMA, reduced subcarrier spacing |
| 802.11ax (6 GHz) | 2021 | Wi-Fi 6E | Adds **6 GHz** band, freshest spectrum, worst wall penetration |
| 802.11be | Present | Wi-Fi 7 | Up to **46 Gbps**, **320 MHz** channels, Multi-Link Operation |

#### 802.11b (1999) - Wi-Fi 1
Operates on an unlicensed ISM frequency with a channel bandwidth of 22 MHz, delivering a maximum theoretical output of 
11 Mbps with a fallback of 1–2 Mbps using Complementary Code Keying (CCK). Although ratified concurrently with 802.11a 
by the IEEE in 1999, 802.11b hit the commercial market first—earning the retroactively applied "Wi-Fi 1" moniker—because
2.4 GHz silicon transceivers were significantly cheaper and easier to manufacture at scale than 5 GHz hardware.

#### 802.11a (1999) - Wi-Fi 2
Operates on the 5 GHz band using OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing), offering speeds up to 54 Mbps. 
Ratified alongside 802.11b in 1999, 802.11a is designated "Wi-Fi 2" because its more expensive and complex 5 GHz 
transceivers delayed widespread commercial adoption until after 802.11b had already established market dominance. 
While faster than 802.11b, its higher frequency resulted in a shorter effective range and weaker obstacle penetration.

#### 802.11g (2003) - Wi-Fi 3
Used the same OFDM technology as 802.11a while returning to the 2.4 GHz band, combining the higher 54 Mbps speeds of 
802.11a with the broader range and wall penetration of 802.11b while maintaining full backward compatibility with Wi-Fi 
1 hardware.

#### 802.11n (2009) - Wi-Fi 4
The first standard considered genuinely capable for demanding commercial environments. It introduced selectable 
dual-band operation across both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz while implementing MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output) antenna 
architecture to boost maximum data rates up to 600 Mbps.

#### 802.11ac (2013) - Wi-Fi 5
The first Wi-Fi standard to break the gigabit barrier, delivering theoretical speeds up to 3.5 Gbps. Operating 
exclusively on the wider 5 GHz band, it introduced wider channel bandwidths (up to 160 MHz) and Multi-User MIMO 
(MU-MIMO) for simultaneous downstream transmission to multiple clients.

#### 802.11ax (2019) - Wi-Fi 6
Introduced dual-band support across both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz, utilizing Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access 
(OFDMA), tighter subcarrier spacing (78.125 kHz), and schedule-based resource allocation (Target Wake Time) to massively
increase efficiency and reduce latency in dense client environments.

#### 802.11ax (2021) - Wi-Fi 6E
While sharing the underlying 802.11ax protocol with Wi-Fi 6, Wi-Fi 6E represents a major hardware leap by extending 
operations into the newly opened 6 GHz frequency band. This provides up to 1,200 MHz of fresh, uncongested spectrum 
free from legacy device interference. However, as demonstrated in our interactive simulator, higher-frequency 
wavelengths suffer from rapid free-space path loss and severe wall attenuation, making 6E the standard with the lowest 
obstacle penetration capability in our model.

#### 802.11be (Present) - Wi-Fi 7
Fully backward compatible with previous standards, Wi-Fi 7 operates across all three bands (2.4, 5, and 6 GHz), supports
theoretical data rates up to 46 Gbps, introduces ultra-wide 320 MHz channels, and implements Multi-Link Operation (MLO) 
allowing devices to simultaneously send and receive data across multiple frequency bands.

### Interactive Elements

#### Wi-Fi Floor Plan Simulator

A 2D floor plan editor where users paint wall materials onto a grid, drag the router around, and toggle a live signal-strength overlay. The heatmap updates as soon as an edit finishes, and when the user switches between Wi-Fi generations, visually demonstrating how different standards handle range, frequency, and obstacle penetration.

**The Grid**

The floor plan is a tile-based rectangular grid (40x30 cells) rendered top-down on a `<canvas>` element. Each cell represents approximately one square meter. Users paint cells by clicking or click-dragging.

**Paintable Cell Types**

| Cell Type | Signal Effect |
| --- | --- |
| Empty space | Distance falloff only |
| Drywall (interior wall) | -3 dB attenuation |
| Concrete (exterior wall) | -12 dB attenuation |
| Metal appliance | -20 dB attenuation |

**Router Placement**

A router marker is displayed on the grid. Users press and drag the marker to reposition it; it can't be dropped on a wall cell, and the heatmap overlay refreshes as soon as the drag ends.

**Signal Overlay**

Toggling the Signal button on the toolbar computes a signal heatmap for the active generation using a max-heap Dijkstra propagation algorithm. Rather than forcing a simple straight-line Euclidean falloff, the engine dynamically calculates the path of least resistance—allowing signals to realistically route around heavy obstacles like metal appliances if doing so preserves more dBm than punching through them. Signal strength along any evaluated trajectory is calculated as:

$$\text{Signal}_{\text{raw}} = S_{\max} - (C_d \cdot d_{\text{path}}) - \sum_{i=1}^{n} (A_{i} \cdot P_{w})$$

Where $S_{\max}$ is the starting transmission power, $C_d$ is the frequency-band distance decay coefficient, 
$d_{\text{path}}$ is the **accumulated path distance** from the router along the optimal Dijkstra trajectory, 
$A_i$ is the material attenuation decibel loss of obstacle $i$ along that path, and $P_w$ is the specific generation's 
wall penetration capability factor.

After the primary Dijkstra routing pass, a two-pass orthogonal diffusion loop bleeds the remaining signal around sharp 
corners to eliminate artificial line-of-sight shadow artifacts. The resulting data is then clamped and normalized to a 
**0.0** to **1.0** scale for canvas color rendering.


Switching to a generation that's already cached is an instant lookup; switching to one that isn't triggers a single fresh computation for just that generation. Any floor plan edit or router move invalidates the cache and recomputes the active generation once the stroke or drag finishes.

| Color | Signal Strength |
| --- | --- |
| Green | Strong signal |
| Yellow | Moderate signal |
| Red | Weak signal |
| White | No signal / dead zone |

**Wi-Fi Generation Switcher**

A tab strip above the heatmap lets users cycle through seven generations:

WiFi 1 (802.11b) -> WiFi 2 (802.11a) -> WiFi 3 (802.11g) -> WiFi 4 (802.11n) -> WiFi 5 (802.11ac) -> WiFi 6 (802.11ax) -> WiFi 6E


Selecting a generation updates the heatmap canvas and displays a short summary description of that generation's signal characteristics. WiFi 7 (802.11be) is covered in the exhibit text but not yet modeled in the simulator.

## Style Guide

### Layout & Spacing

The exhibit uses a clean, article-style layout with the Wi-Fi simulator placed at the end of the page as a synthesis activity — after the background history, frequency band explainer, and per-standard sections. The simulator itself is a single live view with no mode switching. Controls are grouped in a toolbar above the canvas. The generation summary sits above the canvas, between the generation tabs and the grid; the heatmap legend sits below the canvas.

### UI Components & Tone

The main UI component is the `WifiHeatmapExplorer`, which uses shadcn/ui (Sera preset) for all buttons and tabs. The Sera preset was chosen for its sharp, non-rounded aesthetic which suits a technical instrument-style tool.

**Floor plan / heatmap view:**
- Toolbar with wall material brush buttons (Drywall, Concrete, Metal, Eraser), a Clear All button, and a Signal toggle that switches the canvas between a plain floor plan and the live heatmap overlay
- shadcn Tabs generation selector spanning the canvas width, with a detail row showing the selected generation's IEEE standard, year, and frequency band
- One-line generation summary above the canvas, shown when the overlay is on
- Canvas with `cursor-crosshair` for painting and `cursor-grab` when hovering or dragging the router; renders flat wall colors with grid lines when the overlay is off, or the signal heatmap with translucent wall outlines when it's on
- Router position status line below the canvas
- Color legend below the canvas, shown when the overlay is on
